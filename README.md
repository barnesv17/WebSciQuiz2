The Home page represents the iconic bright pinks color scheme from the "I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It" 1975 era. The YouTube video is a 1975 self-titled song in collaboration with climate change activist Greta Thunberg. I feel that this video justly introduces the 1975's work involving sustainability and social justice.

The About page represents the classic 1975 black and white color scheme. The animated city in the background is a reference to the song "The City". All information on this page is taken from Wikipedia.

The Songs page is a mix of styles from "A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships" and "Notes on a Conditional Form". The floating colorful squares are based on the album cover for "A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships". The hints bright yellow are inspired by the "Notes on a Conditional Form" yellow. At the bottom of the page is the vertically-oriented album title with the bright yellow, combining both album's styles.
